Version 0.2.0 (2016-06-26) Major Update
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
It has been almost 8 months since `ezsummary 0.1.9` was released on CRAN. I hope this is a good time, if not too late, to do a major update. In this new version, I introduced a few attractive features by completely recoding some key functions in this package. In most cases, you will find the outcome of `ezsummary()` look the same as the outcome of the old version. However, there are a few cases that the new version behaves slightly differently with the old version (mostly with column namings). I'm sorry for any inconvenience caused by this update.

Here is a list of new features introduced by this update:
- Two shorthand function `ezsummary_q()` and `ezsummary_c()` were introduced for `ezsummary_quantitative()` and `ezsummary_categorical()`.
- `ezsummary()` now takes `...` as options and these options will be passed to `ezsummary_q()` and `ezsummary_c()`.
- You can now define customized analysis in `ezsummary()` and `ezsummary_q()` to produce any analyses you want. Please see ******* for details.
- When you want `ezsummary()` to analyze both quantitative and categorical variables. now you have two output modes: `ez`(default) and `details`. Mode `ez` will generate an integrated table like `ezsummary 0.1.9` while Mode `details` will generate a list of two with quantitative and categorical variables in different tables. Mode `details` allows you to have different number of analyses run for those two types of data.
- Option `round.N` will be deprecated. Use `digits` instead.
- You now have the option to select rounding methods from `round`, `signif`, `ceiling` and `floor`.
- In categorical analyses, option `P` (for percentages) will be deprecated. Instead, now you can select the type of proportion outputby setting the value of `p_type` to be either "percent" or "decimal". You can no longer display both percent and decimal outputs because it's sort of meaningless.
- There is a new switch called `total` to display counts of records including NA.
- There is a new switch called `missing` to display counts of missing records.
- A new option called `fill` is available when you set the `flavor` to be `wide`. The value of `fill` will be passed to `tidyr::spread()` and decide what to fill the NA slots generated by the "spread" step.
