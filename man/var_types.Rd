\usage{
var_types(tbl, types)
}

\item{tbl}{A data.frame}

\item{types}{Character vector of length equal to the number of variables in the

}
\description{
In order to analyze variables in the most appropriate way using this
\code{ezsummary} package, you'd better let the computer know what types of data
(quantitative or categorical) you are asking it to compute. This function will
attach a list of types you entered with the datasets so functions down the stream
line can read these information and analyze based on that. The information is stored
in the attributes of the dataset
